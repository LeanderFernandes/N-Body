N-Body Serial, Shared and Distributed
Folders are named after the specific method I was implementing:

Pythonic - seriel code for single core
mp - multithreaded code for a single node
distributed - distributive code for multiple nodes Testing was done in these folders
The final codes being run on BC4 are in \bluecrystal with the job scripts used to run these files in job_script. Relative paths were used so the scripts are broken and will most probably cause an error. The files used for timings have some functions that are not called but used for making plots.

The final submission report is in the form of a PDF with the accompanying videos in the root directory.
