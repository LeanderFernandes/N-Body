# N-Body Seriel, Threaded and Distributed
This repo was used to create a safe testing environment for development of my n-body code. Being able to push and pull code allowed me to work on my personal and university computer.
Since It allowed for easy code transfer between my personal development area and Bluecrystal without the need for SCP.
Folders are named after the specific method I was implementing:
* Pythonic - seriel code for single core
* mp - multi threaded code for a single node
* distributed - distributive code for multiple nodes
